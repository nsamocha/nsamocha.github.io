Padding is the area around the content, and around the padding is the border. Outside that is the Margin.
What did you learn about CSS positioning?

What I learned is similar to what I learend while doing lesson 3.4. Positioning iteams was very difficult for me at first, especially with text which would always overlap during my attempts to make them overlap an image.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest part was probably linking the css files to the html. At first I thought it was going to be a headace because it wasn't working, then when I realized what I was doing wrong I felt stupid because of what a small mistake it was. The hardest part was actually something I couldn't get to work. I was trying to make the text overlap on my photo.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

Something I was doing wrong before was, when I wanted to effect the text in my body I would start the css code with body. When I should of started it with h1 and h2, which what the text to started with that was in the body.
