  <h1>What is the differennce between Margin, Border and Padding?</h1>
  <p>
<h3>The terms margin, border, and padding all refer to a type of element known as a CSS box model. A box model is meant to help you organize your html code and position everything on your site. It creates spaces in between your different html elements, according to how you want them laid out. To be more specific, the margin is all the way on the outside of the page around the border. It's size depends on how much space you want to take up outside of the border. Also it has no color. An example of the syntax can look something like this:
  p {
    margin-top: 100px;
    margin-bottom: 100px;
    margin-right: 150px;
    margin-left: 50px;
}
This adds a margin to the top bottom and right and left side of the page.
The border, which is inside the margin, goes around the padding. It does more than just help clear space and position elements. The border property can let you stylize a specific elements border. Heres an example:
P{
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: green;
  border-top-style: dotted; (to effect an individual side)
}
Padding is the last part of the CSS box model. It is used to create space around the content on your web-page. ex:
p {
    padding-top: 25px;
    padding-right: 50px;
    padding-bottom: 25px;
    padding-left: 50px;
}
Like the margin, it can also specify the top, right bottom and left side padding size.
