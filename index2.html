<p>Hello, my name is Nimi Samocha. I have been programming for about two months. Before I signed up to Devbootcamp I was going to community college trying to finish my general ed. After realizing that I had very little direction in college, I thought it would be a better idea to develop a skill that could possibly get me a job. I found out about codeacedmy and just tried to have fun with it. I have very little experience with computers and even less with programming. I was very uneasy about deciding to become a programmer and work as one because of how demanding it sounded. Especially when I would try to get opinions online. I would get some positive answers about how important programming is to the world and how everyone should learn it, but occasionaly I would come across something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MticYPfFRp8">this</a> which would make me reconsider. In the end of all my research and contemplating I decided that despite all the bad aspects of programming, I still really enjoyed it.</p>
